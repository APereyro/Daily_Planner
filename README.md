# Daily Planner

## Description
Daily Planner is a web application that allows you to plan your daily schedule by hour. You can enter your tasks or events for each hour of the day and save them in your browser's local storage, so that they will still be there if you close the application and come back later. The application also shows you the current date and highlights the time blocks according to whether they are in the past, present, or future.

## Usage

To use Daily Planner, simply open the application in your web browser. You will see a table with rows for each hour of the day and columns for the time, description, and save button. You can click on the description cell for any hour and enter your task or event for that time. Once you have entered your task or event, click the save button to save it to your browser's local storage. If you need to edit or delete a task or event, simply click on the description cell and make the changes you need.
The application will automatically highlight the time blocks according to whether they are in the past, present, or future. The current time is determined by your computer's clock. If you are using the application in a different time zone, the time blocks may not be highlighted correctly.

Daily Planner was created by Alan Pereyro using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and the Day.js library with the help of my classmates, instructor, and TA's. The design is based on the Bootstrap framework.
